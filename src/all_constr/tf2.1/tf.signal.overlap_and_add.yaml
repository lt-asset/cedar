aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.signal.overlap_and_add
constraints:
  frame_step:
    descp: An integer or scalar `Tensor` denoting overlap offsets. Must be less than
      or equal to `frame_length`.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    default: None
    descp: An optional name for the operation.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  signal:
    descp: A [..., frames, frame_length] `Tensor`. All dimensions may be unknown,
      and rank must be at least 2.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
exceptions:
- ValueError: If `signal`'s rank is less than 2, or `frame_step` is not a scalar integer.
inputs:
  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - signal
  - frame_step

outputs: A `Tensor` with shape `[..., output_size]` containing the overlap-added frames
  of `signal`'s inner-most two dimensions.
