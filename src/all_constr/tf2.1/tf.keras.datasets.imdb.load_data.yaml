aliases:

constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: Used for backwards compatibility.
  index_from:
    default: '3'
    descp: index actual words with this index and higher.
    dtype:
    - int
  maxlen:
    default: None
    descp: sequences longer than this will be filtered out.
  num_words:
    default: None
    descp: max number of words to include. Words are ranked by how often they occur
      (in the training set) and only the most frequent words are kept
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  oov_char:
    default: '2'
    descp: words that were cut out because of the `num_words`or `skip_top` limit will
      be replaced with this character.
    dtype:
    - int
  path:
    default: imdb.npz
    descp: where to cache the data (relative to `~/.keras/dataset`).
  seed:
    default: '113'
    descp: random seed for sample shuffling.
    dtype:
    - int
  skip_top:
    default: '0'
    descp: skip the top N most frequently occurring words (which may not be informative).
    dtype:
    - int
  start_char:
    default: '1'
    descp: The start of a sequence will be marked with this character. Set to 1 because
      0 is usually the padding character.
    dtype:
    - int
    structure:
    - list
exceptions:
- ValueError: in case `maxlen` is so low that no input sequence could be kept.
