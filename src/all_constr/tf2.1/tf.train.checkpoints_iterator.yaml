aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.train.checkpoints_iterator
constraints:
  checkpoint_dir:
    descp: The directory in which checkpoints are saved.
  min_interval_secs:
    default: '0'
    descp: The minimum number of seconds between yielding checkpoints.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  timeout:
    default: None
    descp: The maximum number of seconds to wait between checkpoints. If left as `None`,
      then the process will wait indefinitely.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  timeout_fn:
    default: None
    descp: Optional function to call after a timeout.  If the function returns True,
      then it means that no new checkpoints will be generated and the iterator will
      exit.  The function is called with no arguments.
inputs:
  optional:
  - min_interval_secs
  - timeout
