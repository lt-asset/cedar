constraints:
  new_shape:
    default: None
    descp: None or a vector representing the new shape for the returned`SparseTensor`.
    structure:
    - list
    tensor_t:
    - SparseTensor
  sp_input:
    descp: The input `SparseTensor`.
exceptions:
- TypeError: If `sp_input` is not a `SparseTensor`.
- ValueError: If `new_shape` represents a tensor with a different rank from that of
    `sp_input` (if shapes are known when graph is constructed).
- ValueError: If `new_shape` is determined during graph build to have dimension sizes
    that are too small.
- OpError: '- If `new_shape` has dimension sizes that are too small. If shapes are
    not known during graph construction time, and during run time it is found out
    that the ranks do not match. '
inputs:
  optional:
  - new_shape
  required:
  - sp_input

outputs: A `SparseTensor` indices and values unchanged from `input_sp`. Its shape
  is   `new_shape` if that is set. Otherwise it is the tight bounding box of    `input_sp`
