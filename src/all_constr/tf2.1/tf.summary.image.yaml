constraints:
  data:
    descp: A `Tensor` representing pixel data with shape `[k, h, w, c]`, where `k`
      is the number of images, `h` and `w` are the height and width of the images,
      and `c` is the number of channels, which should be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (grayscale,
      grayscale with alpha, RGB, RGBA). Any of the dimensions may be statically unknown
      (i.e., `None`). Floating point data will be clipped to the range [0,1).
  description:
    default: None
    descp: Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown
      is supported. Defaults to empty.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  max_outputs:
    default: '3'
    descp: Optional `int` or rank-0 integer `Tensor`. At most this many images will
      be emitted at each step. When more than`max_outputs` many images are provided,
      the first `max_outputs` many images will be used and the rest silently discarded.
    dtype:
    - int
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    descp: A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this
      name prefixed by any active name scopes.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  step:
    default: None
    descp: Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted,
      this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.
exceptions:
- ValueError: if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and`tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`
    is None.
inputs:
  optional:
  - step
  - max_outputs

  required:
  - name
  - data

outputs: True on success, or false if no summary was emitted because no default summary
  writer was available.
