aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.map_fn
constraints:
  back_prop:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
    dtype:
    - tf.bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  dtype:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) The output type(s) of `fn`.  If `fn` returns a structure of
      Tensors differing from the structure of `elems`, then `dtype` is not optional
      and must have the same structure as the output of `fn`.
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence of the resulting
      slices will be applied to `fn`.
    structure:
    - list
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed.  It accepts one argument, which will have
      the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`.  Its output must have the same
      structure as `dtype` if one is provided, otherwise it must have the same structure
      as `elems`.
  infer_shape:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
    dtype:
    - tf.bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
  parallel_iterations:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel. When graph
      building, the default value is 10. While executing eagerly, the default value
      is set to 1.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  swap_memory:
    default: 'False'
    descp: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
    dtype:
    - tf.bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
exceptions:
- TypeError: if `fn` is not callable or the structure of the output of`fn` and `dtype`
    do not match, or if elems is a SparseTensor.
- ValueError: if the lengths of the output of `fn` and `dtype` do not match.
inputs:
  optional:
  - dtype
  - parallel_iterations
  - back_prop
  - swap_memory
  - infer_shape
  - name
  required:
  - fn
  - elems

outputs: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors.  Each tensor packs the
  results of applying `fn` to tensors unpacked from `elems` along the first dimension,
  from first to last.
