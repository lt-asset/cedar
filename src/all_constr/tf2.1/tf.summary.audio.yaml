constraints:
  data:
    descp: A `Tensor` representing audio data with shape `[k, t, c]`, where `k` is
      the number of audio clips, `t` is the number of frames, and `c` is the number
      of channels. Elements should be floating-point values in `[-1.0, 1.0]`. Any
      of the dimensions may be statically unknown (i.e., `None`).
    ndim:
    - '0'
    - '3'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
    shape:
    - '[k,t,c]'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  description:
    default: None
    descp: Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown
      is supported. Defaults to empty.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  encoding:
    default: None
    descp: Optional constant `str` for the desired encoding. Only "wav" is currently
      supported, but this is not guaranteed to remain the default, so if you want
      "wav" in particular, set this explicitly.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
  max_outputs:
    default: '3'
    descp: Optional `int` or rank-0 integer `Tensor`. At most this many audio clips
      will be emitted at each step. When more than`max_outputs` many clips are provided,
      the first `max_outputs`many clips will be used and the rest silently discarded.
    dtype:
    - int
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  name:
    descp: A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this
      name prefixed by any active name scopes.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  sample_rate:
    descp: An `int` or rank-0 `int32` `Tensor` that represents the sample rate, in
      Hz. Must be positive.
    dtype:
    - int
    - tf.int32
    ndim:
    - '1'
    shape:
    - '[0]'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  step:
    default: None
    descp: Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted,
      this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.

- k
- c
exceptions:
- ValueError: if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and`tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`
    is None.
inputs:
  optional:
  - step
  - max_outputs
  - encoding
  - description

  - name
  - data
  - sample_rate

outputs: True on success, or false if no summary was emitted because no default summary
  writer was available.
