constraints:
  '**kwargs':
    descp: ''
  '*inputs':
    descp: Positional arguments that are the inputs to print. Inputs in the printed
      output will be separated by spaces. Inputs may be python primitives, tensors,
      data structures such as dicts and lists that may contain tensors (with the data
      structures possibly nested in arbitrary ways), and printable python objects.
    structure:
    - list
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  end:
    default: None
    descp: End character that is appended at the end the printed string. Defaults
      to the newline character.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  output_stream:
    default: None
    descp: The output stream, logging level, or file to print to. Defaults to sys.stderr,
      but sys.stdout, tf.compat.v1.logging.info, tf.compat.v1.logging.warning, tf.compat.v1.logging.error,
      absl.logging.info, absl.logging.warning and absl.loogging,error are also supported.
      To print to a file, pass a string started with "file://" followed by the file
      path, e.g., "file:///tmp/foo.out".
    dtype:
    - tf.string
  sep:
    default: None
    descp: The string to use to separate the inputs. Defaults to " ".
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  summarize:
    default: None
    descp: The first and last `summarize` elements within each dimension are recursively
      printed per Tensor. If None, then the first 3 and last 3 elements of each dimension
      are printed for each tensor. If set to -1, it will print all elements of every
      tensor.
exceptions:
- ValueError: If an unsupported output stream is specified.
inputs:
  optional:
  - output_stream
  - summarize
  - sep
  - end
  - name
  required:
  - '*inputs'
  - '**kwargs'

outputs: None when executing eagerly. During graph tracing this returns a TF operator
  that prints the specified inputs in the specified output stream or logging level.
  This operator will be automatically executed except inside of `tf.compat.v1` graphs
  and sessions.
