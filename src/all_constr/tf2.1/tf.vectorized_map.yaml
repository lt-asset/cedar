aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.vectorized_map
constraints:
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unpacked along their first dimension. The nested sequence of the resulting slices
      will be mapped over by `fn`.
    structure:
    - list
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed. It accepts one argument, which will have
      the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`, and returns a possibly nested
      structure of Tensors and Operations, which may be different than the structure
      of `elems`.
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - fn
  - elems
link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.1/api_docs/python/tf/vectorized_map
outputs: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors. Each tensor packs the
  results of applying fn to tensors unpacked from elems along the first dimension,
  from first to last.
