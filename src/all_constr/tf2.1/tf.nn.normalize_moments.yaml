  counts:
    descp: A `Tensor` containing the total count of the data (one value).

    descp: 'A `Tensor` containing the mean sufficient statistics: the (possibly shifted)
      sum of the elements to average over.'

  name:
    default: None
    descp: Name used to scope the operations that compute the moments.
  shift:
    descp: A `Tensor` containing the value by which the data is shifted for numerical
      stability, or `None` if no shift was performed.

    descp: 'A `Tensor` containing the variance sufficient statistics: the (possibly
      shifted) squared sum of the data to compute the variance over.'
