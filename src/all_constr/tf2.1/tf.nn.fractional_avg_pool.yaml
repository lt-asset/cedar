  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  overlapping:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional `bool`.  Defaults to `False`.  When set to `True`, it means
      when pooling, the values at the boundary of adjacent pooling cells are used
      by both cells. For example:`index  0  1  2  3  4``value  20 5  16 3  7`If the
      pooling sequence is [0, 2, 4], then 16, at index 2 will be used twice.  The
      result would be [20, 16] for fractional avg pooling.

  pooling_ratio:
    descp: A list of `floats` that has length >= 4.  Pooling ratio for each dimension
      of `value`, currently only supports row and col dimension and should be >= 1.0.
      For example, a valid pooling ratio looks like [1.0, 1.44, 1.73, 1.0]. The first
      and last elements must be 1.0 because we don't allow pooling on batch and channels
      dimensions.  1.44 and 1.73 are pooling ratio on height and width dimensions
      respectively.

  pseudo_random:
    default: 'False'
    descp: An optional `bool`.  Defaults to `False`. When set to `True`, generates
      the pooling sequence in a pseudorandom fashion, otherwise, in a random fashion.
      Check paper Benjamin Graham, Fractional Max-Pooling for difference between pseudorandom
      and random.

    ndim:

  seed:
    default: '0'
    descp: An optional `int`.  Defaults to `0`.  If set to be non-zero, the random
      number generator is seeded by the given seed.  Otherwise it is seeded by a random
      seed.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:

  value:
    descp: A `Tensor`. 4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`.
