constraints:
  estimator:
    descp: A `tf.estimator.Estimator` object.
  metric_fn:
    descp: 'A function which should obey the following signature: Args: can only have
      following four arguments in any order:predictions: Predictions `Tensor` or dict
      of `Tensor` created by given`estimator`.features: Input `dict` of `Tensor` objects
      created by `input_fn` which is given to `estimator.evaluate` as an argument.labels:  Labels
      `Tensor` or dict of `Tensor` created by `input_fn`which is given to `estimator.evaluate`
      as an argument.config: config attribute of the `estimator`.Returns: Dict of
      metric results keyed by name. Final metrics are a union of this and `estimator''s`
      existing metrics. If there is a name conflict between this and `estimator`s
      existing metrics, this will override the existing one. The values of the dict
      are the results of calling a metric function, namely a `(metric_tensor, update_op)`
      tuple. '

inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - estimator

outputs: A new `tf.estimator.Estimator` which has a union of original metrics with   given
  ones.
