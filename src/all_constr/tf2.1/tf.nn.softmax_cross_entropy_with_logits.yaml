check_nan: true
constraints:
  axis:
    default: '-1'
    descp: The class dimension. Defaulted to -1 which is the last dimension.
    dtype:
    - int
  labels:
    descp: Each vector along the class dimension should hold a valid probability distribution
      e.g. for the case in which labels are of shape`[batch_size, num_classes]`, each
      row of `labels[i]` must be a valid probability distribution.
    ndim:
    - '1'
    - '2'
    shape:
    - '[batch_size,num_classes]'
    - '[i]'
  logits:
    descp: Per-label activations, typically a linear output. These activation energies
      are interpreted as unnormalized log probabilities.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'

- i
- num_classes
- batch_size
inputs:
  optional:
  - axis
  - name
  required:
  - labels

outputs: A `Tensor` that contains the softmax cross entropy loss. Its type is the
  same as `logits` and its shape is the same as `labels` except that it does not have
  the last dimension of `labels`.
