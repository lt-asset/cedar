aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.nondifferentiable_batch_function
constraints:
  allowed_batch_sizes:
    default: None
    descp: Optional list of allowed batch sizes. If left empty, does nothing. Otherwise,
      supplies a list of batch sizes, causing the op to pad batches up to one of those
      sizes. The entries must increase monotonically, and the final entry must equal
      max_batch_size.
    structure:
    - list
  autograph:
    default: 'True'
    descp: Whether to use autograph to compile python and eager style code for efficient
      graph-mode execution.
    dtype:
    - tf.bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  batch_timeout_micros:
    descp: Maximum number of microseconds to wait before outputting an incomplete
      batch.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  max_batch_size:
    descp: Batch sizes will never be bigger than this.
  max_enqueued_batches:
    default: '10'
    descp: The maximum depth of the batch queue. Defaults to 10.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
  num_batch_threads:
    descp: Number of scheduling threads for processing batches of work. Determines
      the number of batches processed in parallel.
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
inputs:
  optional:
  - allowed_batch_sizes
  - max_enqueued_batches
  - autograph
  required:
  - num_batch_threads
  - max_batch_size
  - batch_timeout_micros
