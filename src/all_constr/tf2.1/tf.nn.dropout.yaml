constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for this operation (optional).
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  noise_shape:
    default: None
    descp: A 1-D `Tensor` of type `int32`, representing the shape for randomly generated
      keep/drop flags.
    dtype:
    - tf.int32
    ndim:
    - '0'
    - '1'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  rate:
    descp: A scalar `Tensor` with the same type as x. The probability that each element
      is dropped. For example, setting rate=0.1 would drop 10% of input elements.
    ndim:
    - '0'
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See`tf.random.set_seed`
      for behavior.
    dtype:
    - int
  x:
    descp: A floating point tensor.
    dtype:
    - float
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
exceptions:
- ValueError: If `rate` is not in `[0, 1)` or if `x` is not a floating point tensor.
    `rate=1` is disallowed, because theoutput would be all zeros, which is likely
    not what was intended.
inputs:
  optional:
  - noise_shape
  - seed
  - name
  required:
  - x
  - rate
