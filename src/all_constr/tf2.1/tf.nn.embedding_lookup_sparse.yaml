check_nan: true
constraints:
  combiner:
    default: None
    descp: A string specifying the reduction op. Currently "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum"
      are supported. "sum" computes the weighted sum of the embedding results for
      each row. "mean" is the weighted sum divided by the total weight. "sqrtn" is
      the weighted sum divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the
      weights.
  max_norm:
    default: None
    descp: If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than
      this value, before combining.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the op.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  params:
    descp: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of
      P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded
      embedding tensors.  Alternatively, a`PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning
      along dimension 0. Each element must be appropriately sized for `"div"` `partition_strategy`.
    ndim:
    - '0'
    structure:
    - list
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  sp_ids:
    descp: N x M `SparseTensor` of int64 ids where N is typically batch size and M
      is arbitrary.
    dtype:
    - tf.int64
    tensor_t:
    - SparseTensor
  sp_weights:
    descp: either a `SparseTensor` of float / double weights, or `None` to indicate
      all weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, `sp_weights`must have exactly
      the same shape and indices as `sp_ids`.
    dtype:
    - float
    - tf.float64
    tensor_t:
    - SparseTensor
exceptions:
- TypeError: If `sp_ids` is not a `SparseTensor`, or if `sp_weights` is neither `None`
    nor `SparseTensor`.
- ValueError: If `combiner` is not one of {"mean", "sqrtn", "sum"}.

outputs: A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the sparse ids. For
  each row in the dense tensor represented by `sp_ids`, the op looks up the embeddings
  for all ids in that row, multiplies them by the corresponding weight, and combines
  these embeddings as specified.
