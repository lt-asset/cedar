- tf.compat.v1.image.random_jpeg_quality
constraints:
  image:
    descp: 3D image. Size of the last dimension must be 1 or 3.
  max_jpeg_quality:
    descp: Maximum jpeg encoding quality to use.
  min_jpeg_quality:
    descp: Minimum jpeg encoding quality to use.
  seed:
    default: None
    descp: An operation-specific seed. It will be used in conjunction with the graph-level
      seed to determine the real seeds that will be used in this operation. Please
      see the documentation of set_random_seed for its interaction with the graph-level
      random seed.
