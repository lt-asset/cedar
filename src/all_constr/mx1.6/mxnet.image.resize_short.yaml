      Nearest Neighbors Interpolation. 1: Bilinear interpolation. 2: Bicubic interpolation
      over 4x4 pixel neighborhood. 3: Area-based (resampling using pixel area relation).
      It may be a preferred method for image decimation, as it gives moire-free results.
      But when the image is zoomed, it is similar to the Nearest Neighbors method.
      (used by default). 4: Lanczos interpolation over 8x8 pixel neighborhood. 9:
      Cubic for enlarge, area for shrink, bilinear for others 10: Random select from
      interpolation method metioned above. Note: When shrinking an image, it will
      generally look best with AREA-based interpolation, whereas, when enlarging an
      image, it will generally look best with Bicubic (slow) or Bilinear (faster but
      still looks OK). More details can be found in the documentation of OpenCV, please
