    descp: CUDA devices for which to fork the RNG.  CPU RNG state is always forked.  By
      default, `fork_rng()` operates on all devices, but will emit a warning if your
      machine has a lot of devices, since this function will run very slowly in that
      case. If you explicitly specify devices, this warning will be suppressed
    doc_dtype: iterable of CUDA IDs
    structure:

  enabled:
    default: 'True'
    descp: if `False`, the RNG is not forked.  This is a convenience argument for
      easily disabling the context manager without having to delete it and unindent
      your Python code under it.
